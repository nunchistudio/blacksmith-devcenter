# Blacksmith developer center

Blacksmith allows **software engineers** to **E**xtract, **T**ransform (if desired),
and **L**oad data across services. This can be done using YAML / JSON configuration
only, or using our SDKs directly from third-party applications. It also allows
**data engineers** to run operations (a.k.a. **T**ransformations), queries (a.k.a.
*SELECT*s), and migrations on top of any SQL database.

This approach lets engineering teams collaborate on managing a unique data
engineering platform from end-to-end.

Any team that is building — or think about building — such a platform knows the
tremendous amount of work needed to properly accomplish this mission. Think of
Blacksmith as the central piece of your data engineering workflow, leading you to
save months of customized and professional work.

## Product offerings

**Blacksmith is not an open-source software.** This repository only holds useful
developer resources. Blacksmith itself is built and distributed as a CLI and as
a Docker image.

[Blacksmith is available in two Editions](https://nunchi.studio/blacksmith/pricing):
- **Blacksmith Standard Edition** is aimed at individuals and small teams. It
  addresses the technical challenges they face when building cloud-native and
  reliable data engineering solutions.
- **Blacksmith Enterprise Edition** is aimed at larger teams. It addresses the
  governance and collaboration challenges they face when working on more complex
  data solutions. It brings additional features such as *namespaces* (for
  multi-tenancy) and an integration with the Elastic Stack.
