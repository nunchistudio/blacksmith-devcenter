# Blacksmith developer center

Blacksmith offers a unique and consistent DataOps platform, removing most of the
counterproductive tasks data engineers must handle. It allows engineering teams
to benefit from a complete low-code workflow with advanced data quality and
reliability out-of-the-box from end-to-end:

Any team that is building — or think about building — such a platform knows the
tremendous amount of work needed to properly accomplish this mission. Think of
Blacksmith as the central piece of your data engineering workflow, leading you to
save months of customized and professional work.

## Features and benefits

### Invincible ETL / ELT

Blacksmith architecture is designed to:
- **Survive anything**: Blacksmith provides hard guarantees around the durability
  of data and seamlessly deals with long-running operations, retries, and
  intermittent failures.
- **Scale easily**: Scalability is another crucial advantage of using Blacksmith
  for data processing. It automatically distributes data and workload demand
  across workers.
- **Deploy everywhere**: Blacksmith works on any machine and any cloud to respect
  organizational, technical, and legal requirements your organization or customers
  might have.

[The interactive tour](https://nunchi.studio/blacksmith/tour) allows you to
configure your integrations along ETL / ELT within a few lines:

```yml
sources:
  - name: "my-source"
    defaults:
      subscription:
        driver: "kafka"
    triggers:
      - name: "my-trigger"
        mode: "subscription"
        config:
          subscription:
            topic: "<topic>"
            queue: "<consumer-group>"
```

### Database operations

Blacksmith exposes a Python / Django-syntax like templating-language when working
with SQL files. This is a convenient way to generate SQL dynamically interpolating
the template with contextual data and returning the compiled SQL file.

```sql
{% if order %}
INSERT INTO orders (id, amount, user_id, created_at)
  VALUES (
    '{% uuid %}',
    {{ order.amount | floatformat:2 }},
    '{{ user.id }}',

    {% if order.created_at %}
      '{{ order.created_at }}'
    {% else %}
      '{% now "2006-01-02 15:04:05" %}'
    {% endif %}
  );
{% endif %}
```

Load & Transform data within multiple SQL databases leveraging the native dialect
of each one:

Run `SELECT` in your database and download the returned rows as CSV and JSON:

## Product offerings

**Blacksmith is not an open-source software.** This repository only holds useful
developer resources. Blacksmith itself is built and distributed as a CLI and as
a Docker image.

[Blacksmith is available in two Editions](https://nunchi.studio/blacksmith/pricing):
- **Blacksmith Standard Edition** is aimed at individuals and small teams. It
  addresses the technical challenges they face when building cloud-native and
  reliable data engineering solutions.
- **Blacksmith Enterprise Edition** is aimed at larger teams. It addresses the
  governance and collaboration challenges they face when working on more complex
  data solutions. It brings additional features such as *namespaces* (for
  multi-tenancy) and a deep integration with the Elastic Stack.
