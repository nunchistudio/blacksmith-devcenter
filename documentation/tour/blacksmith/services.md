### Blacksmith services

Blacksmith is composed of three kind of services:
- The **server** is the orchestration service. The server itself does not execute
  application code, but instead tracks the state of it using queues, timers, and
  a database. It is highly scalable and multi-tenant, capable of running millions
  of tasks simultaneously. It employs various sharding techniques to ensure
  scalability internally. And it is capable of scaling horizontally by running
  multiple instances on multiple hosts.
- The **workers** are services that executes the code against integrations. There
  are two types of workers:
  - The **loader** is in charge of **L**oading data asynchronously into integrations.
    This worker is necessary if you leverage Blacksmith for ETL / ELT.
  - The **operator** is in charge of running *migrations* and *operations* 
    synchronously against SQL integrations. It leverages a remote *mutex* for
    handling access locks. This worker is necessary if you leverage Blacksmith
    for SQL migrations and operations.
- The **gateway** is a YAML / JSON-only application to **E**xtract data from
  various sources and Load it into integrations. The gateway is very handy for
  capturing events across sources without knowing any programming language.
