### Working with topics

Once registered, an integration of type `topic` allows to interact with a message
broker for **L**oading (a.k.a. *publishing*) data into a topic. Within a trigger
in the gateway:
```yml
sources:
  - name: "my-source"
    # ...
    triggers:
      - name: "my-trigger"
        # ...
        integrations:
          - name: "my-topic"
            transformation:
              # ...
            options:
              # ...
```
