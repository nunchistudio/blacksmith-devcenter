### Working with blob stores

Once registered, an integration of type `blob` allows to interact with a blob
store for **L**oading data into a bucket. Within a trigger in the gateway:
```yml
sources:
  - name: "my-source"
    # ...
    triggers:
      - name: "my-trigger"
        # ...
        integrations:
          - name: "my-bucket"
            transformation:
              # ...
            options:
              # ...
```
