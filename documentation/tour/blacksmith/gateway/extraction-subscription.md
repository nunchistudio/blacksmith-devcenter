### Extraction from subscription

A trigger of mode subscription (`subscription`) allows to **E**xtract messages
received in a subscription of a message broker. It is done by subscribing to a
*queue* using the details passed in the source's `defaults.subscription` config
and the `config.subscription` of the said trigger.

Once **E**xtracted (in other words, once a message was published and received into
the defined trigger), the trigger exposes:
- `status`: The status of the Extraction process. It is one of `succeeded`,
  `failed`.
- `meta`: The JSON marshaled metadata of the message, if any. Example:
  ```json
  {
    "language": "en",
    "source": "js-sdk"
  }
  ```
- `body`: The JSON marshaled body of the request passed by the client. Example:
  ```json
  {
    "user": {
      "id": "4d6c34df-250e-4fb5-bfb2-27e8d4e9becf",
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Doe",
      "username": "johndoe",
      "address": {
        "city": "Austin"
      }
    },
    "subscriptions": [
      {
        "id": "206b0e36-0d24-43f7-9e9c-c1fdf2cd4780",
        "name": "Enterprise Edition",
        "sku": "BLACKSMITH_EE",
        "quantity": 1.0
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

The value of each of the keys defined above can be passed to integrations using
the `transformation` object.
