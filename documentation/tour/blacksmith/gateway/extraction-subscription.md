### Extraction from subscription

A trigger of mode subscription (`subscription`) allows to **E**xtract messages
received in a subscription of a message broker. It is done by subscribing to a
*queue* using the details passed in the source's `defaults.subscription` config
and the `config.subscription` of the said trigger.

Once **E**xtracted (in other words, once a message was published and received into
the defined trigger), the trigger returns a JSON object with:
- `status`: The status of the **E**xtraction. It is one of `success`, `failure`.
- `meta`: The JSON metadata of the message received by the broker, if any.
- `body`: The JSON body of the message received by the broker.

Knowing this, a trigger of mode `subscription` shall return an object like this:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "meta": {
    "language": "en",
    "source": "js-sdk"
  },
  "body": {
    "user": {
      "id": "4d6c34df-250e-4fb5-bfb2-27e8d4e9becf",
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Doe",
      "username": "johndoe",
      "address": {
        "city": "Austin"
      }
    },
    "subscriptions": [
      {
        "id": "206b0e36-0d24-43f7-9e9c-c1fdf2cd4780",
        "name": "Enterprise Edition",
        "sku": "BLACKSMITH_EE",
        "quantity": 1.0
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This object is then available in the `transformation` object for each integration
configured within the trigger, as described below.
