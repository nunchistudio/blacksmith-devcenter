Given the example defined above and the `mapping` defined in the example on the
*code* section, the JSON message published into the topic would be:

  "subscription_id": "206b0e36-0d24-43f7-9e9c-c1fdf2cd4780",
  "sku": "BLACKSMITH_EE",
  "quantity": 1.0
}
```

And the metadata associated to the message would be:
