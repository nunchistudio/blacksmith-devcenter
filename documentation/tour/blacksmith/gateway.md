### About the gateway

The Blacksmith **gateway** is a YAML / JSON-only application to **E**xtract data
from various sources, **T**ransform (if desired) and **L**oad it into integrations.
The gateway allows to have an end-to-end ETL pipeline without knowing any
programming language and without worrying about data reliabilty: Blacksmith handles
orchestration under the hood thanks to its server / worker architecture.
