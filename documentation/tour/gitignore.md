### Versioning with Git

One of the main pros of leveraging Blacksmith is to benefit a single repository
for versioning your entire data engineering platform. This allows to follow best
practices and a unique workflow across data, software, and cloud engineers.

It is also possible to version across multiple repositories and teams / customers
using namespaces formulti-tenancy.
