Blacksmith uses environment variables for environment-specific configuration and
for sensitive information â€” such as connection strings.

To simplify this approach, Blacksmith automatically load these variables from
`.env` files, if any. It first loads the ones from the `.env` file. Then the ones
from `.env.development` where `development` is the value of the variable
`BLACKSMITH_ENV`. Order matters since no environment variables are overridden.

The variables present in this file should always be the same across repositories
when working in a multi-repositories setup. Otherwise, you will end up with
different repository structures leading to confusion and misconfiguration.
