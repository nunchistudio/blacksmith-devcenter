# Managing migrations

## Running migrations

Once a migration is generated with the `generate` command, it can be run with:
```bash
$ blacksmith migrations run \
  --integration warehouse

1 migration to run for warehouse:
  - 20210809135841.init.up.sql (new)

Blacksmith will run the migrations as shown above. Do you confirm?
Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.
> yes

Executing migrations:

  -> Executing 20210809135841.init.up.sql...
     Success!
```

You can also run migrations until a given version is reached (including):
```bash
$ blacksmith migrations run \
  --integration warehouse \
  --version 20210809135841

1 migration to run for warehouse:
  - 20210809135841.init.up.sql (new)

Blacksmith will run the migrations as shown above. Do you confirm?
Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.
> yes

Executing migrations:

  -> Executing 20210809135841.init.up.sql...
     Success!
```

Migrations are executed ordered by version from oldest to newest. If an error
occured while executing a migration, the others will not be executed. You first
need to fix the failing migration to be able to run it again along the others
awaiting to run.

## Rolling back migrations

Mistakes can happen. This is why you sometimes need to *rollback* a migration,
or a suite of migrations.

When rolling back, the `version` flag must be provided. All migrations will be
rolled back until the version is reached (including).

For example, to rollback every migrations down to the version `20210422135835`:
```bash
$ blacksmith migrations rollback \
  --integration warehouse \
  --version 20210422135835

2 migrations to roll back for warehouse:
  - 20210422140548.fix_userid_pk.down.sql (applied)
  - 20210422135835.init.down.sql (applied)

Blacksmith will roll back the migrations as shown above. Do you confirm?
Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.
> yes

Executing migrations:

  -> Executing 20210422140548.fix_userid_pk.down.sql...
     Success!

  -> Executing 20210422135835.init.down.sql...
     Success!
```

Migrations are rolled back ordered by version from newest to oldest. If an error
occured while rolling back a migration, the others will not be rolled back. You
first need to fix the failing migration to be able to rollback it again along the
others awaiting to be rolled back.

## Discarding migrations

When rolled back, a migration is not discarded. Which means you can still update
its `up` / `down` logic and try to run it again. However, if you need to discard
a migration once it is successfully rolled back, you can add the `--discard` flag
as follow:
```bash
$ blacksmith migrations rollback \
  --integration warehouse \
  --version 20200930071321 \
  --discard
```

This will mark the migration as `discarded` so it will not be run again.

## Checking the status

Before running or rolling back migrations, we advise to always check the
migrations' status of the integration:
```bash
$ blacksmith migrations status \
  --integration warehouse

2 migrations to run for warehouse:
  - 20210422135835.init.up.sql (rolled back)
  - 20210422140548.fix_userid_pk.up.sql (rolled back)
```

Even though the `run` and `rollback` commands display the migrations that will
be executed and prompt a confirmation, this allows to be more confident and avoid
mistakes as much as possible.
