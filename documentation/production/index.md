# Production best practices

Since Blacksmith is highly scalable and can be downloaded as a single binary for
all platforms, it's really easy to deploy and orchestrate it on any infrastructure.
Like any other technology, they are some tricks to make this experience as peaceful
as possible.

The following guides are meant to provide *guidance* for an ideal deployment of
Blacksmith, not to document requirements. Even though it's really not recommended,
it's possible to deploy Blacksmith without applying any of the following
recommendations.

The **Configuration** section focuses on the Blacksmith configuration to apply
for optimised and secure deployments. Each guide within this section should be
considered as an item to do for an ideal production configuration:

[x] Explicit Blacksmith version
[x] Appropriate policies
[x] Well-defined models
[x] Retention and archival
[x] TLS everywhere

Once done, you are ready to **Deploy & Manage** your Blacksmith application using
the technology of your choice.
