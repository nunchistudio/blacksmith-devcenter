# Tour of the dashboard

As of now, Blacksmith does not have a dedicated dashboard yet. In the meantime,
the Docker stack defined in the `Docker-compose.yml` brings the default Temporal
UI.

It is accessible at <http://localhost:8088>.

While following the next guides, we encourage to navigate in the dashboard to 
better understand the *workflows*.
