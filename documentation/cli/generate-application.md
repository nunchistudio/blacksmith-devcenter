# `blacksmith generate application`

This command generates the files for creating a new Blacksmith application. It
is the recommended way for a developer to get started quickly and efficiently.

**Example:**
```bash
$ blacksmith generate application \
  --name myproject \
  --path ./myproject

Generating files:

  -> Generating application at ./myproject
     Success!
```

## Required flags

- `--name [name]`: Set the name of the application. It shall be a valid name only
  containing lowercase letters (`a-z`), underscores (`_`), and dashes (`-`).

  **Aliases:** `-n [name]`

  **Example:**
  ```bash
  $ blacksmith generate application \
    --name myproject
  ```

## Optional flags

- `--path [path]`: Relative path where the application's files will be generated.
  If the directories don't exist, they will automatically be created (if possible).
  If files already exist at the path with the same name of the ones generated by
  the CLI, an error will be prompted. The CLI will never override existing files.

  **Aliases:** `-p [path]`

  **Example:**
  ```bash
  $ blacksmith generate application \
    --name myproject \
    --path ./myproject
  ```
