# Focus on Enterprise Edition

The Enterprise Edition brings governance and collaboration features to Blacksmith.
It is designed for organizations with multiple teams or multiple customers where
each has it own technical and organizational challenges.

- **Namespaces** allow isolation from one group to another within the cluster
  where each one has its own security and scalability policies. The main use-case
  is for multi-tenancy, with a dedicated namespace for each team or customer.
- The **Elastic Stack** integration allows to index, search, and monitor your
  entire data engineering platform within Kibana. It leverages Elasticsearch for
  indexing and APM for observability.
